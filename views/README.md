#### Syntax rules

Functions interact directly with the file naming within this tree.  
In order to work as expected the following naming convention should be maintained.

- 2 Words maximum per file naming.
- Naming should be `camelCase` followed by `_view.php`.
- If the naming only has one single word as name, should be all small case followed by `_view.php`.
